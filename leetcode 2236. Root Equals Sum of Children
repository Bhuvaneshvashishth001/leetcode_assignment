2236. Root Equals Sum of Children

actually it is so easy problem because in this we give only one root with its left and right but try to give something from yourself do in different way try it with your own first think about
agar ye esa hota too yaa phir esa hota too 
that's why i have done this problem in the different way to think about for differebt root with its left and right

 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
